    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 01, 2026</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>YOU.AI</strong> mobile application (herein referred to as "Application"). This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application does not collect or store any personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number. We value your privacy and aim to keep our data footprint to a minimum.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Anonymous Device ID:</strong> The Application may use an anonymous device identifier. This ID does not carry any personal information and is used solely to distinguish between different devices for technical purposes and analytics. It cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Please find the links to the privacy policies of these third-party service providers below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=uk" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob may use device identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests. This process is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions (RevenueCat)</h2>
    <p>For processing subscriptions and in-app purchases, we use RevenueCat. RevenueCat helps us manage your access to premium features. While RevenueCat tracks transaction history associated with an anonymous ID, it does not have access to your credit card details or bank information — these are handled securely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store).</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The Application does not store your photos, documents, or any other content on our servers. All processing is done locally on your device or via secure API calls that do not retain your data.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at: <strong>leffberg@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

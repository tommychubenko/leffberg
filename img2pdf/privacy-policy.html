    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 8, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Too Simple: Photo to PDF</strong> application (hereinafter referred to as the "App") handles your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and **do not collect**, store, or transfer any personal information (such as name, phone number, or contacts) to our own servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Device Permissions (Camera and Photos)</h2>
    <p>To function correctly, the App requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used exclusively to allow you to take photos of documents directly within the app for conversion to PDF.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library (Gallery):</strong> Used to select existing images for conversion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Important: All images are processed locally on your device. We do not have access to your photos outside of the conversion process.</em></p>

    <h2>3. Local Storage (Async Storage)</h2>
    <p>The App uses your device's local storage to save your settings and temporary data. This data remains on your phone and is deleted when the App is uninstalled.</p>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Analytics (Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <p>To support the free version of the App, we use third-party services that may collect technical device information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect your device's advertising identifier (IDFA/AAID) to show relevant ads. You can review their policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy & Terms</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> In future updates, the App will use this service to manage subscriptions and purchases. All payment information is processed through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect information from children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly interact with the personal data of children.</p>

    <h2 id="data-deletion">6. Data Deletion Instructions</h2>
    <p>Since <strong>Too Simple: Photo to PDF</strong> does not require account creation and does not store personal data (like name or email) on its servers, there is no personal account data to delete. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> To delete all data stored locally by the App, simply uninstall the App from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> You can reset or delete your advertising identifier through your Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads).</li>
        <li><strong>General Requests:</strong> If you believe any other data has been collected, you can send a deletion request to <a href="mailto:leffberg@gmail.com">leffberg@gmail.com</a>. We will process your request within 48 hours.</li>
    </ul>
